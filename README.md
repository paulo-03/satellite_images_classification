# Satellite Image Classification

This repository contains my implementations for a satellite image classification task provided by Swisscom as part of a coding test for my Master's thesis application in industry, completing my Masterâ€™s degree in Data Science. The project includes a baseline model using random forest with feature engineering, and a deep learning model using fine-tuning of ResNet18.
